Implementation of three classification algorithms using the CRISP-DM methodology on a heart disease dataset.

This project entails applying the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework to develop and implement three different classification algorithms on a heart disease dataset. CRISP-DM, a well-known and systematic approach to data mining, provides a structured process consisting of six key phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment.

By following these phases, this project ensures a comprehensive and methodical analysis. Each step, from understanding the domain-specific problem of predicting heart disease to cleaning and preparing the dataset, is meticulously carried out. The classification algorithms are then selected, trained, and tuned to maximize predictive performance. The resulting models are evaluated against key performance metrics to identify the best approach for accurately predicting heart disease outcomes.
